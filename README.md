# Soundsphere CS Calc
While making Soundsphere skins, you constantly have to find the right coordinate system values. Either through trial and error, or by endless calculations. Well, no more! This tool lets you easily calculate, convert and copy values. It's always on screen and nice and small, so you don't have to go back and forth between it and your editor.
